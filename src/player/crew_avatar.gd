extends Node3D
## What your crewmates look like — the third-person body for every remote player.
##
## DESIGN.md: "Crewmates are humanoid program avatars — sleek dark shells with
## emissive circuit seams in their player color." M3.7 swaps the capsule-and-
## boxes placeholder for the CyberSentinel model wearing the **inverted** palette:
## a pale shell with the accents burning in the owner's lobby colour, against the
## enemy's near-black-and-red.
##
## That inversion is the entire readability argument. The silhouette is
## deliberately shared with the thing hunting you — you are an intrusion program
## rendered inside MOTHER's architecture, so of course you are wearing her
## shapes — and colour is what separates *crewmate* from *quarantine process* in
## the tenth of a second a beam sweeps past one. Bright shell, blue-ish accents,
## and a nameplate: friend. Black shell, red core: not.
##
## This is explicitly an **interim** body. The user will ship a dedicated crew
## model; when that lands, only `MODEL` and the clip names below change.
##
## ## Locomotion
##
## The clips are authored cycles on the rig (idle / walk / run, plus a kneel and
## a rise for M3's corrupted state) blended by an AnimationTree and time-scaled by
## the avatar's **replicated** speed. Nothing about the animation crosses the
## wire: `Player.sync_speed` is already streamed for the head-bob, and running the
## same blend off it on every peer costs nothing and cannot desynchronise.
##
## The stride constants below are the metres each authored cycle carries the body
## in one loop. Dividing real speed by the stride gives the playback rate that
## keeps the feet planted — get these wrong and the avatar moonwalks, which is
## the single most obvious animation fault there is.

const MODEL: String = "res://assets/models/crew_avatar.glb"

## The speed each clip was authored to travel at, in metres per second —
## measured off the exported cycles, not guessed: walk carries the body 1.560 m
## in its 1.0 s loop, run 2.467 m in its 0.667 s loop. Dividing real speed by
## these gives the playback rate that keeps the feet planted.
const WALK_SPEED_AUTHORED: float = 1.56
const RUN_SPEED_AUTHORED: float = 3.70
## Below this the avatar is standing still whatever the packets say.
const IDLE_SPEED: float = 0.35
## Cross over to the run clip well below the player's 4.2 m/s walk. Pushing the
## walk cycle to the 2.7x it would need at full walking speed reads as
## scampering; the run clip at 1.14x reads as a person moving.
const RUN_SPEED: float = 3.6
## Clamp on the playback rate, so a clip is never pushed so hard it buzzes or so
## slow it freezes mid-step.
const RATE_RANGE: Vector2 = Vector2(0.45, 2.2)

## Head-look limits, in radians. Same reasoning as the Sentinel's: a head that
## snaps is a turret, a head with no limit is an owl.
const LOOK_YAW_LIMIT: float = 0.9
const LOOK_PITCH_LIMIT: float = 0.5
const NECK_SHARE: float = 0.4

## Crew palette. Pale enough to be a readable silhouette at 15 m in a beam.
## "Pale" against an architecture that sits at 0.095 and an enemy that sits at
## 0.04 — not white. The first pass authored these at 0.60/0.74 and any light
## that touched them at arm's length blew straight to paper, which in first
## person meant your own forearm was the brightest object on screen.
const SHELL: Color = Color(0.33, 0.36, 0.41)
const PLATE: Color = Color(0.45, 0.48, 0.54)
## The default accent when a player has no colour yet. DESIGN.md's "default
## swatch bright blue".
const DEFAULT_ACCENT: Color = Color(0.32, 0.62, 1.0)
## Deliberately modest.
##
## 2.6 was chosen for the third-person read at 15 m and is completely wrong in
## first person: the same seams then sit 30 cm from the lens, where they blow
## straight through the ACES shoulder and turn your own chest into two white
## bars. Readability at distance comes from the PALE SHELL — a bright silhouette
## against near-black architecture — and the accents only have to say whose
## silhouette it is.
const ACCENT_ENERGY: float = 1.0

## Bone the breaker is socketed to.
const HAND_BONE: String = "Right wrist"
## The rifle's resting transform in that bone's space, so it sits in a closed
## fist rather than sprouting out of the wrist along the forearm. Measured in
## Blender against the same posed hand `aim_idle` holds, and carried across as a
## **quaternion on purpose**: a bone's own frame survives the glTF y-up
## conversion unchanged but the rifle's does not, so the socket rotation is not
## expressible as the axis-aligned euler it looks like it should be — and
## Godot's `Basis.from_euler` defaults to YXZ, which would silently give a third
## wrong answer.
const HAND_OFFSET: Vector3 = Vector3(0.00200, 0.08282, -0.03931)
const HAND_ROTATION: Quaternion = Quaternion(0.570398, -0.072270, 0.808570, 0.125055)

## Everything descended from this bone is "upper body" and takes the rifle-hold
## pose; everything below it keeps walking. Computed from the skeleton, so a
## re-export that adds a finger does not need a code change.
const SPLIT_BONE: String = "Spine"

## Chest pitch applied on top of the hold pose, in radians.
##
## The authored `aim_idle` carries the rifle 34 degrees below the view axis —
## which is a correct low-ready and, at the player's 74-degree FOV, puts the
## weapon almost entirely under the bottom edge of the screen. Rather than send
## the clip back for a re-author, the chest is pitched up a little at runtime,
## which lifts both arms and the rifle together and reads as a program bringing
## its tool up rather than as a weapon floating higher.
##
## Sign matters and is not guessable: this rotates about the avatar's own right
## axis pulled into the chest bone's parent-pose space, and positive there
## pitches the chest FORWARD. At 0.92 rad the shoulder eats a third of the
## frame; 0.34 puts the rifle in the lower-right where a held tool belongs.
const AIM_LIFT: float = 0.34

## First-person hold offset — the classic viewmodel cheat, and the reason every
## shooter you have ever played has a weapon that is anatomically in the wrong
## place.
##
## An honest two-handed low ready puts the rifle and both hands below the bottom
## edge of a 74-degree frame, because that is where a person actually holds a
## rifle they are not aiming. Games lie about this on purpose: the hold is
## translated up and toward the lens until the receiver, the foregrip and some
## knuckles ride in the lower-right of the frame, which is what makes a player
## feel they are holding something.
##
## Applied to the CHEST bone, so the arms, the hands and the weapon move as one
## piece rather than the rifle sliding out of its own grip — and applied **only
## on the owning peer**. Remote crewmates keep the honest pose, because from
## across a room the cheat would read as a program carrying its tool up by its
## chin. Same model, two truths, one of them for an audience of one.
const FP_HOLD_OFFSET: Vector3 = Vector3(0.02, 0.075, -0.045)
## Small numbers: this shifts the CHEST, and every joint from the shoulder down
## the arm multiplies it, so what reads as a 4 cm nudge at the sternum is a
## hand's width at the muzzle. The first tuning pass used 13 cm and put the
## player's own shoulder across a third of the screen.
##
## The inward cant is OFF, and it is left here documented rather than deleted
## because it is the obvious next knob and it is a trap: rolling the chest about
## its forward axis swings the near shoulder straight into the lens, and at any
## value large enough to turn the receiver's face toward the camera it also puts
## a pale slab across a third of the frame. If the weapon needs to show its side,
## rotate the socket, not the torso.
const FP_HOLD_CANT: float = 0.0
## Where the animation tracks live, relative to the AnimationPlayer's root.

## Render layer reserved for "the local player's own body and tool".
##
## Your beam is a spotlight bolted to your head; it lights the room and it can
## never light your own chest, so a fully embodied first-person player in a game
## this dark is holding an invisible rifle in invisible hands. Every game that
## has ever shipped a viewmodel solves this with a light that only the viewmodel
## can see, and this is that light: the body and the weapon are tagged onto a
## spare render layer, and one dim omni is culled to that layer alone. It cannot
## brighten the world by a single lumen — which is the whole point, because the
## darkness is the game.
